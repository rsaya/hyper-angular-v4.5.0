Hyper Angular is created using Angular CLI.

In case if you don't know - Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool to help developers build angular applications with simply just one command. It set up and configures everything automatically and so you don't need to configure anything manually (e.g. No need to install and configure tools like webpack or babel). they are preconfigured by creating angular app.
